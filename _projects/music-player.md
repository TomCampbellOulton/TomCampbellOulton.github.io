overview: >
  A music player I made (using chatgpt) to replace spotify. It downloads the lyrics for each song from an API, and highlights each line for each song when it plays, gives music recommendations based on your most listened to songs, sorts by genre and allows custom playlists to be created.
tools:
  - Python
  - OS Module
  - JSON Module
  - urllib Module
  - threading Module
  - dataclasses Module
