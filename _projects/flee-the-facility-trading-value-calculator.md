overview: >
  I created a webscraper that downloads the value of the sets from the ftf values website and uses them to calculate the total value of a users inventory.
  To make my life easier, I also developed a program that collects the sets that the user has in their inventory and records the quantity of each one so I could see how many of each set / item I had available to trade.
  I plan on combining this further to calculate the user's total set value automatically from these programs as well as making a stock predictor for how well the sets will perform based on the limited historical data I have collected.
  The reason I also saved images of the text names for every gem and hammer was due to a small number being incorrectly read, so as an easy work around I saved the images to compare to for future use and let the program try naming them for me to then check. If they were correct (which over 95% were) then I left them alone, if they were misnamed I renamed them with the correct names to ensure the program would work properly for future iterations.
  The database that I designed to store the data is normalised to 3rd normal form to ensure it's both efficient in storing the data and is easy to update any issues that I may find further down the line.
