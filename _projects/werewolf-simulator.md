title: Werewolf Simulator
subtitle: Simulation of the Werewolf game
tags: [Python, Simulator]
year: 2024
overview: >
  A simulator I created to better understand the Werewolf game, and to verify the results I'd heard that in a game where the minority hold the knowledge, those with the knowledge are the ones in power. This simulator "proves" it by agreeing on the results that the werewolves normally win, despite being the minority.
tools:
  - Python
  - matplotlib Module
