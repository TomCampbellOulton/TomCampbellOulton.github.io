overview: >
  A community ran project to make alt accounts on Roblox Bee Swarm Simulator run to benefit your main account, using bots on Discord to synchronize with one another so when the macro makes your main account move to a particular region, your alt accounts are all notified and move accordingly.
  I updated an older version of tadsync to incorporate a few important features, allowing newer patterns (2025) to be used and disable mondo looting for alt accounts.
