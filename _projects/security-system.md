overview: >
  An example security system I built (using chatGPT) to use multiple cameras to record what's happening. If the intruder is recognised as a friendly face, the recording stops, if they are recognised as an unwelcome face, or an unknown face they are recorded and the user can be notified about the intrusion.
  (Work in progress)
tools:
  - Python
  - face_recognition Module
