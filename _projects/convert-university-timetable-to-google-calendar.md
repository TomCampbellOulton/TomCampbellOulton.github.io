title: University Timetable to Google Calendar Converter
subtitle: A scraper to convert the University of Liverpool timetable to a csv file compatible with Google Calendar
tags: [Python, Roblox Flee The Facility]
year: 2026
overview:
    I and many of my peers wanted our timetables to be in google calendar instead of having to use a separate website to view them so I created a scraper that took the information from their website, converted it into a csv file which can then be directly imported into Google Calendar.
    This project is open source and free to be used by anyone. :)
tools:
  - Python
  - PlayWright
