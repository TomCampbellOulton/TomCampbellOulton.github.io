title: University Timetable to Google Calendar Converter
subtitle: A scraper to convert the University of Liverpool timetable to a csv file compatible with Google Calendar
tags: [Python, Roblox Flee The Facility]
year: 2026
overview:
    I and many of my peers wanted our timetables to be in google calendar instead of having to use a separate website to view them so I created a scraper that took the information from their website, converted it into a csv file which can then be directly imported into Google Calendar.
    Initially I had planned on making it automatically update the google calendar, but as that would require an API key I decided it was safer to just return the csv file so the users can freely use the output as they see fit, and can still very easily upload it to their google calendars. It also reduces security risk slightlyy by reducing the number of passwords being given to the program.
    When using the tool, I strongly recommend deleting the username and password from the config file after use just to be safe. :)
    This project is open source and free to be used by anyone. :)
tools:
  - Python
  - PlayWright
