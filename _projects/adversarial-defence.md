title: Adversarial Defence
subtitle: An assignment for an Advanced Artificial Intelligence Module, to desgin and implement a defensive model against adversarial attacks made by the other students

overview: >
  An adversarial Defence.
  As an academic project for part of my Advanced Artificial Intelligence module, we had to design an adversarial defence that would be used on the Fashion-MNIST dataset and tested against the other student's attack algorithms. 
  My adversarial defence scored an average accuracy of 59.49% across clean and contaminated data, scoring 67% on the assignment.
  The reasoning for my defence being weaker than my attack was due to poor training algorithms, not training it sufficiently with contaminated data and over fitting to a particular set of attack algorithms.
  The iterations of my defence are available on my GitHub.
