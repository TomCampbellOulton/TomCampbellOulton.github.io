        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Tom Campbell-Oulton, a 2nd year student studying Computer Science BSc (Hons) – Artificial Intelligence or Data Science pathway degree at the University of Liverpool, with a keen interest in finding ways to automate the small, repetitive tasks of my daily life.</p>
        <p>At the moment I still plan on taking all the required modules for both the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence pathway for my degree, albeit only one can be listed on the final certificate.</p>
        <p>I use generative AI tools like ChatGPT to quickly prototype small projects and I declare it on the project pages and github pages respectively. 
            For instance, my music and video players started as AI-generated builds, which I then refined over several weeks. 
            More recent experiments, such as simulations of the Monty Hall problem and the Tuesday Boy problem, also began as rapid prototypes. 
            In these projects, the focus is on functionality rather than efficiency or safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            For academic work or professional projects, I do not use generative AI.
        </p>
